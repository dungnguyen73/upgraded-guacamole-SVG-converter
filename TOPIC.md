Centerline extraction
You're given 7 PNG icons — 1024×1024, a single solid-black shape on a white/transparent background. Write a program that, for each PNG, outputs an SVG whose paths follow the centerline (the medial axis) of the shape instead of its outline.

An Hdrawn with a thick black stroke should come out as three thin stroked paths — two vertical, one horizontal — joined at the intersections. You're turning a filled shape back into the skeleton a person would draw with a pen.

Sample inputs and reference SVGs: ./pictographic-challenge

Output
For each <name>.png, write <name>.svg with viewBox="0 0 1024 1024" and stroked <path> elements (fill="none") tracing the medial axis. The reference uses stroke-width="45" with rounded caps and joins — any reasonable width that resembles the original is fine.

Ground rules

No third-party libraries. Building it is the point.
Any language — Python is easiest, but we'll review anything reasonable.
Include a short README explaining your approach, what you'd improve with more time, and where your output diverges from the reference and why.
Hint
Rough direction: convert the PNG to a binary mask → trace the shape's contour → use perpendiculars across the stroke to find midpoints → connect those midpoints into paths. The rest is up to you.

Evaluation:
Correctness — centerlines land in the right place and stroke intersections preserve the right topology.
Algorithmic understanding — you can explain why your thinning works, not just that it does. We'll ask in the follow-up.
Judgment with AI tooling — using AI to write the code is fine; using it without reading what it produced is not. Own every line.
Communication — your README makes it easy to see what you built and where the rough edges are.
